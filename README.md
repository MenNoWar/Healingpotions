# Healingpotions

## What..
Healingpotions adds four different Healing-, Stamina- and Eitr-Potions that will add different percent values of your current maximal stat 
and are crafted in a cauldron.

As the only alternative for vanilla meads (at least i currently found) only adds absolute values this one adds 
a percentage of your current base stat. You will get the difference when having around 300 Stat :)

## Potions
Each of the potion recipes need Dandelion as base item.<br />
The second required item is the quality of the potion.<br />
- Mushroom = Small Potion = gives 25% of the stat back<br />
- Thistle = Medium Potion = gives 50% of the stat back<br />
- Obsidian = Huge Potion = gives 75% of the stat back<br />
- Flax = Godly Potion = gives 100% of the stat back<br />

The 3rd item specifies the type of the potion.<br />
- Raspberry = Healing Potion<br />
- Blueberries = Stamina Potion<br />
- MushroomYellow = Eitr/Mana Potion<br />

#### Hint: 
- the potions look nice as decoration on an itemstand (depending on taste)
- each potion has a minimal cooldown of 3 seconds
