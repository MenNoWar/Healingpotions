# Healingpotions

## What..
Healingpotions adds four different Healingpotions that will add different % values of your current maximal health 
and are crafted in a cauldron.

As the only alternative for vanilla healing meads (at least i currently found) only adds absolute values this one adds 
a percentage of your current base hp. You will get the difference when having around 300Hp :)

## Potions
Each of the potion recipes need Dandelion and Blueberries as base items. 
Additionaly there is one item, depending on the Biome the potion is intended to be used mostly.

Item | Requires | Biome | Cauldron Level | Heals
--------|-------|--------|---------------|------
Healing Potion | Base + Mushroom | Meadows | 1 | 25%
Medium Healing Potion | Base + Thistle | Black Forest | 2 | 50%
Huge Healing Potion | Base + FreezeGland | Mountains | 3 | 75%
Godly Healing Potion | Base + Flax | Plains | 4 | 100%

#### Hint: 
- the potions look nice as decoration on an itemstand (depending on taste)
- each potion has a minimal cooldown of 3 seconds
